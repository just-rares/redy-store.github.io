# REDY
REDY is an online commerce platform, where users can sign up as a seller or a buyer and meet their desires.

# Objectives
1.  Users (both suppliers and customers) should be able to register and sign in securely.
    
2.  Sellers can place items in a system by entering item details (name, description, quantity, price per item, etc.) under specific categories (books, films, etc).
    
3.  Customers must have an adequate search mechanism for easy and quick access to particular products (e.g., filtering based on suppliers, price range, and reviews/star ratings).
    
4.  There will be a shopping cart so that customers can add a specific number of items and check out. For this assignment, you don't need to implement the checkout process.
